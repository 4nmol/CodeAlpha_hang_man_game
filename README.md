Hangman Game Project 🎮🔤

I completed the Hangman Game project as an intern at Code Alpha 💻. The game involves guessing a hidden word by suggesting letters, with limited attempts before losing the game! ⏳

Key Features:
Word Guessing: Players try to guess a word by inputting letters. 🧠
Limited Chances: Only a few incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends. ❌
Interactive UI: Simple, user-friendly interface for easy play. 🎨
Random Word Selection: The game chooses random words from a predefined list. 📜
Win/Lose Feedback: Clear feedback on whether the player has won or lost. 🏆💀
The project enhanced my skills in Python 🐍, logic implementation 🔧, and user interface design 🖥️. It was a great learning experience with Code Alpha. 🌟
